The world is changing.I can feel it in the water.I can feel it in the earth.I smell it in the air.Much, what once was, is lost, since no one lives anymore, which remembers.It began with the forging of the Great Rings.3 were given to the Elves, to the immortal, wisest and purest of all beings.7 to the dwarf rulers, great miners and craftsmen in their halls of stone.And 9... 9 rings were given to the people who strive above all others for power.For these rings bare the strength and the will to guide every people.But they were all deceived.Because another ring was made.In the land of Mordor, in the fire of the Fate Hill, the Dark Ruler Sauron secretly forged a master ring to dominate all others.In this ring flowed his cruelty, his wickedness and his will to suppress all life.A ring to enslave them.In turn, the free countries of Middle-earth came under the rule of the Ring.But some resisted.A final alliance of people and elves moved into the battle against Mordor.On the slopes of the Destiny Hill they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.The victory was close.But the power of the ring was not to break.Then it happened, when all hope vanished, that Isildur, the king's son, took the sword of his father.Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth, was defeated.The ring went to Isildur, who now had the opportunity to destroy the evil forever.But people's hearts are easy to seduce.And the ring of power has its own will.He betrayed Isildur and brought him death.And what should not have been forgotten, was lost.History became legend. Legend became myth.And for 2500 years the ring was forgotten.Until one day he was looking for a new carrier.My darling.The ring fell into the hands of the creature Gollum, carried into the foggy mountains.And there he fell into the ring.He came to me.My own.My love.My own.My darling.The ring gave Gollum an unnaturally long life.For 500 years he poisoned his mind.And in the darkness of Gollum's cave he waited.Darkness lay over the forest of the world.Rumors were loud about a shadow in the east. A nameless horror went around.And the ring felt that his time had come.He left Gollum.But there was something that the ring had not intended.He was found by the most unlikely creature.What's that?A Hobbit.Bilbo Beutlin from the Auenland.A ring.Disappeared!My treasure has disappeared!Because soon comes the time, as the Hobbits will determine the fate of all.The Auenland 60 years laterThe road glides away and away, away from the door, where it began, far across land from place to place, I follow it, as well as I can.You're late.A wizard never comes too late, Frodo Beutlin.Or too soon.It appears exactly as intended.What a pleasure to see you, Gandalf!How could I forget Uncle Bilbo's birthday?What's going on outside in the world?Tell me everything.Everything?For a Hobbit you are too curious.Very unusual.What do you want me to tell you?Life in the wide world is the same as in the past.A constant coming and going.Hardly anyone is aware of the existence of the Hobbits.For which I am very grateful.The long-awaited feast.How's the old man doing?As I heard, it should be a particularly magnificent celebration.You know Bilbo.Here are all from the house.Exactly to his liking.Half of Auenland is invited.You're a little bit sweet!- He's up to something.- In fact. All right.Just keep it to yourself.Before you showed up, we were Beutlin's respected people.We were never entangled in adventure.If you mean the incident with the dragon, I was hardly involved in it.I just pushed your uncle out the door.Whatever you have done, you are now officially considered a troublemaker.Oh, really?Fireworks, Gandalf!- I'm glad you're back.- Me too, my dear boy.Me too.No, thank you!No more visitors, congratulations or distant relatives!And what about very old friends?Bilbo Beutlin.My dear Gandalf!Good to see you. 111 years old.Is that to be believed?You haven't aged a bit.Come in!Welcome, welcome.Tea? Maybe something stronger after all.I still have a few bottles of Age Wingert. 1296.Very good vintage.Almost as old as I am.My father still pressed it.What do you mean, let's open one?Just tea, thank you.I was expecting you last week.But you come and go as you like.Always. I'm a little unprepared.I only have cold chicken and pickles.There's some cheese.No, it's not good anymore.We have raspberry jam, an apple pie.But not much for dessert.Oh, no, we're saved!There's another biscuit cake.I could fry eggs.Just tea, thank you.Oh, of course.Bad when I eat?Not at all.I'm not home!I have to get away from this fucking kinship, never leaves you alone.I want to see mountains again.Mountains, Gandalf!A quiet place where I can finish my book.Oh, the tea.Then you want to carry out your plan?Yes.Everything is ready.All precautions have been taken.Frodo has suspected.Of course he did.He is a beutlin, not a simple belt of rock.You're telling him, aren't you?He likes you very much.I know.He'd probably come with, I'd ask him.I think deep inside Frodo still hangs on the Auenland.At the woods, the fields.The small rivers.I'm old, Gandalf.It doesn't look at me, but I feel it deep in my heart.I feel thin.Somehow emaciated, how butter spread on too much bread.I need a vacation.Very long vacation.And I probably won't return.Honestly, I don't intend to.Old Tobi.The best herb in the whole southern district.Gandalf, my old friend, this evening we will remember many times.Good to see you.Come on, Sam.Request Rosie to dance on.I'd rather have some beer.Oh, no.Go on.There I stood, at the mercy of the three terrifying trolls.They argued about how they should probably cook us, whether grill on the skewer or whether they should sit on us and crush us.They fought over the pros and cons until the first sunlight crawled over the treetops and they all turned to stone.Quickly.No, the big one.- She's got to be in the ground.- She's in the ground.That was your idea.- Watch out, the dragon!- Dragon? Nonsense. There have been no dragons here for 1000 years.That was good.Let's get another one!Meriadoc Brandybock and Peregrin Tuk.I thought so.A speech, Bilbo!A speech!My dear Beutlins and Boffins, Tuks and Brandybocks, Grubers, Pausbackens,Tight belt and pride foot.Today is my 111th birthday!But unfortunately, ninety-one years are far too short to live under such fine hobbits.I don't know half of you half as well as I want, and like less than half of you only half as much as you deserve.I've got things to do.I've delayed it far too long.I regret to announce that this is the end!I'm going now.I say goodbye to you very warmly.Farewell.You must have thought that was very clever.Come on, Gandalf.Have you seen their faces?There are many magic rings in the world, and none should be used recklessly.It was just a little fun.I guess you're right again, as always.You'll have an eye on Frodo, will you?2 eyes.As often as I can spare them.I leave everything to him.What about your ring?Is he staying here too?Yes, yes.He's in an envelope on the mantel.No. No.Isn't that weird?Why not?Why shouldn't I keep it?You should leave the ring behind, Bilbo.Is that so hard?Well, no.And yes.Now that it's time, I don't want to give it up.I found him!No need to get angry.It's your fault!He's mine.My own.My darling.Honey?That's what he was called before, but not by you.What do you care what I do with my stuff?You've had the ring long enough.You want him yourself!Don't think I'm a magician of lazy tricks.I don't want to rob you.I want to help you.All these years we were friends.Trust me, just like before.Give it up.You're right, Gandalf.The ring must go to Frodo.It's late.The path is long.Yes, it's time.You still have the ring in your pocket.Here's the end for my book:And he lived happily afterwards until the end of his days.I'm sure you will, my dear friend.Goodbye, Gandalf.Goodbye, dear Bilbo.Until our next meeting.It's mine.My own.My darling.Mysteries in the Darkness.My darling.Honey.He's gone, isn't he?He talked about it for so long. I thought it was a joke.Bilbo's ring.He opened up to the elves and left you a bag end.With all his possessions.The ring is now yours.Hide him well.Where are you going?I care about things.What things?Questions. That require an answer.You just came.I don't understand.Me neither.Keep him secret.Keep him well.Auenland!Beutlin!The year 3434 of the 2nd Age.These are the records of Isildur, the High King of Gondor, of the discovery of the Ring of Power.He came to me.The one ring.He is an heirloom of my kingdom.My descendants should be bound to his fate, because I do not dare that something happens to the ring.He is my treasure, even if I buy him with great pain.The lines on the ring begin to fade.The font, first as clear as a red flame, has already disappeared.A secret that only fire can reveal.Auenland.Beutlin.There are no beutlins here.They're all in Hobbingen.Over there.Doesn't anyone know about it?Is he well hidden?What are you doing?Hold your hand.He's all cool.What do you see?Do you see anything?Nothing.There's nothing there.Wait.There are lines.Some kind of Elbish.I can't read it.Only a few can.It's the language of Mordor I don't want to speak here.In our language it means:A ring to enslave them, to find them all, to drive into the dark. And to bind forever.This is the One Ring, forged by the Dark Ruler Sauron in the Fire of the Fate Hill.Isildur cut him from Sauron's hand and took him for himself.Bilbo found him.In Gollum's cave.For 60 years, the ring was in Bilbo's custody, extended his life, did not let him age.But that's over.The evil moves into Mordor.The ring has awakened.He's heard his master's reputation.But he was destroyed.Sauron was destroyed.No, Frodo.The spirit of Sauron continued to live.His life force is tied to the ring, and the ring remained.Sauron has returned.His orcs have become more numerous.Its fortress Barad-dúr is rebuilt in Mordor.Sauron only needs this ring to cover all countries in darkness.He's looking for him.Find him.All his thoughts apply to him.And the ring wants nothing more arduous than to return to the hand of its master.They are one, the ring and the Dark Ruler.He must never find him.All right.We'll put him away.We hide him and never mention him again.No one knows where he is, right?Or, Gandalf?Someone knew that Bilbo had the ring.I searched everywhere for the creature Gollum.But the enemy first discovered him.I don't know how long they tortured him.But under endless screams and stutters they recognized 2 words :Auenland.Beutlin.That'll bring them here!Who's there?Take it, Gandalf!- Take it!- No, you have to take it.Don't trust me!I'll give it to you!Don't try me, Frodo!I don't dare to take it.Not even to keep him.You see, Frodo. I would want to do good with this ring.But through me he would possess too great and appalling power.But he can't stay here!He can't.What do I have to do?You have to go.Quickly.Where?Leave the Auenland.Go to Bree.And what about you?I'm waiting for you at the inn to dance pony.Is the ring safe?I don't know, Frodo.I can't say.I must meet the Supreme of my Order.He is wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.He knows advice.You'll have to take the name Beutlin.He's too dangerous outside the Auenland.Travel only in the day.And off the road.I'm just going cross-country.My dear Frodo.Hobbits are really amazing creatures.In a month you can learn everything about them.And 100 years later you can still surprise one.Duck yourself.By my beard, Samweis Gamjie!Have you obeyed?I never obey.I just cut the weed.A little late to cut grass!I heard voices.What did you hear?Don't say anything important.I heard of a ring, a dark ruler andPlease, Lord, don't hurt me.Don't turn me into a monster.No?Maybe not.I thought of something better.Come on, Samweis.Do not dawdle.Be careful, both of you.The enemy has many scouts :Birds, animals.Is he sure?Never use him, for his power attracts the servants of the Dark Ruler.Always remember, the ring is trying to return to its master.He wants to be found.It's time.What's up?One more step, and I'm as far away from home as never before.Come on, Sam.Bilbo always said:It's a dangerous thing, Frodo, to get out of your door.You enter the road, and if you don't watch your feet, you can't know where they're carrying you.Smoke rises above the Fate Hill.It's high time.And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengart and asks me for advice.Because that's why you came, isn't it?My old friend.Saruman.Are you sure about that?Without a doubt.So the ring of power was found.All these years he was in the Auenland.Right in front of my nose.And yet you did not see him.Your preference for the herb of halflings has clouded your senses.But it's still time enough to defeat Sauron if we act quickly.Time?How much time do you think we have?Sauron has regained much of his former strength.He cannot yet take shape, but his spirit has lost nothing of his power.Hidden in his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees everything.His gaze pierces clouds, shadows, earth and flesh.You know what I'm talking about, Gandalf?A big eye, lidlos, bordered by flames.Yes, Sauron.He gathers all evil around him.Soon his army will be strong enough to attack Middle Earth.You know that?How?I've seen it.A Palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman.Why should we be afraid to use it?It is still unexplained where the other seeing stones are.We don't know who else is watching.Time shrinks faster than you think.Sauron's force is already on its way.The 9 have left Minas Morgul.They crossed the river Isen on midsummer evening in the shape of black riders.You're in the Auenland?You'll find the ring.And kill the one who carries him with him.Frodo!Did you really think a Hobbit would come against Sauron's will?There is no one who can do that.There can be no victory against the power of Mordor.We have to ally with him, Gandalf.We have to ally with Sauron.It would be wise, my friend.Tell me, friend, since when does Saruman prefer the wise to the madness of reason?I gave you the opportunity to help me of your own free will, but you decide for the pain!- I thought I lost you.- What are you talking about?Gandalf said something.What did he say?Don't lose him, Samweis Gamjie. I won't.We're still in the Auenland.What can happen to us?Merry, this is Frodo Beutlin.Get off him!What are you doing here?You stole Bauer Maggot's vegetables!Get out of my field!Why is he so upset?It's just a few turnips.And cabbages.And the 3 sacks of potatoes last week.And the mushrooms the week before.Yes, Pippin.I'm telling you, he's overreacting.Run!That was close.I think I broke something.Typical Brandybock and Tuk!What?That was just a shortcut.Cross field.Cross field where?Mushrooms!Let's get off the street.Come on, get off the road!Quick!Quiet!What was that?Do you see anything?Nothing.What's going on?The Black Horseman was looking for something.Someone.Duck!I have to leave the Auenland.Sam and I have to go to Bree.I see.Bockenburg ferry.Follow me.Follow me!Get rid of the dew, Sam!Run, Frodo!Quick!Where else can you get over?Over the Brandy Wine Bridge. 20 miles.Come on.What do you want?We want to get into the dancing pony.Hobbits.4 Hobbits.- What brings you to Bree?- We want to stay at the inn.The reason is our cause.It's all right, young gentleman.I didn't mean bad.After nightfall I have to ask.Are strange people on the way.You can't be careful enough.Excuse me.Good evening, my little gentlemen.If your accommodation is looking for, there are still nice, cozy rooms in Hobbit size free.Sir?Unterberg.My name is Unterberg.Unterberg.We want to go to Gandalf the Grey.I know. Such an old boy.Long, grey beard, pointed hat.He hasn't been here in six months.What do we do now?He's coming.What's that?That, my friend, is a jug of beer.You drink it out of jugs?I'll get one, too.You've had a whole half.That guy's been staring at you since we got here.Excuse me.The man in the corner.Who's that?One of the forest runners.Dangerous people, wandering people.I don't know his real name, but they call him strings.Strings.Beutlin.Beutlin.Beutlin.Of course I know a Beutlin.That's where he's sitting.My cousin 2nd degree, maternally, and my cousin 3rd degree...Watch it.You can't hide.I see you.There is no life in nothingness.Only death.You attract too much attention, Herr Unterberg.What do you want?You're not carrying anything.I'm not wearing anything. Of course.I can avoid seeing me, but completely disappearing, is a rare gift.Who are you?Are you afraid?Yes.By far not enough.I know who's following you.Leave him alone, you long misery!You've got a good heart, kid.But it doesn't save you.Don't wait any longer for the wizard, Frodo.They're coming.Who are they?Once they were humans.Great kings of men.Then Sauron the traitor gave them the 9 rings of power.Blind before greed they accepted them without asking.And fell into the darkness.Now they are slaves of his will.They are the Nazgûl.Ring spirits.Neither alive nor dead.At all times they feel the presence of the ring, driven by the power of the One.They'll hunt you forever.Where are you taking us?Into the wilderness.How do we know Strings is a friend of Gandalf's?We have to trust him.But where does he lead us?To Bruchtal, Mr. Gamjie.Home Elronds.Do you hear that?To Bruchtal.We'll see the Elves.We stop at nightfall.What about breakfast? You had that.The 1st, yes.What about the second breakfast?I don't think he knows anything like that, Pip.And the 11 o'clock snack?Lunch?Four o'clock tea?Dinner?Night meal?He knows that, doesn't he?Don't count on it.The power of Isengart is ready for you, Sauron, ruler of the earth.Give me an army worthy of Mordor.New instructions from Mordor, my master?What does the eye command?There's work.The trees are strong, my master.Their roots penetrate deeply.Pull them all out.This was the watchtower of Amon Sûl.This is where we rest tonight.These are for you.Always carry it with you.I'll take a look around.Stay here.What are you doing?Tomatoes, sausages, crispy bacon.There's something for you too.Turn it off, you twats!Ash on my tomatoes!Up!Back up, you devils!Help him, strings.A Morgulklinge hurt him.For this my healing art is not enough.He needs elbian medicine.- Quick!- It's 6 marches a day to Bruchtal!Hold on, Frodo.He's getting cold.Will he die?He glides over into the shadow world.Soon he will be a ghost like them.They're very close.Do you know the athelas plant?King's herb.Yeah, that's a weed.It stops the poisoning. Hurry up.A forest runner who is not on the alert?I'm Arwen.I'm coming to help you.Listen to my voice.Come back into the light!Who is she?She's an elve woman.He's fading.He won't be doing it long.Let's take him to my father.I've been looking for you for two days.5 ring spirits are behind you.Where the other 4 are, I don't know.Stay with the hobbits.I'll send you horses.I ride faster.The road is too dangerous.What are they talking about?When I cross the river, the power of my people will protect him.I'm not afraid of them.Ride quickly. Don't look back.What are you doing?The ring spirits are still there!Give us the halfling, Elbswoman!If you want him, come and ask for him.Frodo, no.Frodo, don't give up.Not now.May the grace that I have been given pass to him.Spare him.Save him.Where am I?You're in Elrond's house.It's 10 o'clock in the morning of October 24th, if you want to know.Yes, I'm here.And you're lucky you're here too.A few more hours, and we couldn't have helped you anymore.But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.What happened, Gandalf?Why didn't you come?I'm sorry, Frodo.I was stopped.The friendship of Saruman you do not give up lightly.A bad turn is worth the other.It's over.Choose the power of the ring, or choose your own downfall.Lord of the Ring.He alone can make the ring bow to his will.And he doesn't share his power.So you choose death.What's the matter?Nothing, Frodo.How beautiful, you're awake.Sam barely left your side.We were afraid for you, right?Thanks to the arts of Elrond, you're slowly recovering.Welcome to Bruchtal, Frodo Beutlin.Hello, Frodo, my boy.Back and forth :The story of a Hobbit. By Bilbo Beutlin.That's wonderful.I wanted to return, see the wonders of Dark Forest, visit sea town, see the Lonely Mountain again.But as it seems, I'm finally getting old.I miss the Auenland.In my childhood I pretended I wanted to leave.Away with you, experience adventures together.My own adventure then looked quite different.I'm not like you, Bilbo.My dear boy.What did I forget?You've already packed?I just wanted to be prepared.- You wanted to see the Elves.- That's right.- More than anything.- Yes, I do.It's justWe did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?We brought the ring to Bruchtal.I thought, as soon as you get better, we leave.Home.You're right, Sam.We have done what we should do.The ring will be safe in Bruchtal.I'm ready to go home.He's coming back to power.The wound will never heal completely.He carries them with him as long as he lives.Nevertheless, he has come far with the ring and has shown himself extremely resistant to evil.This burden should never have been imposed on him.That's all you can ask of him.The enemy is approaching.Sauron's force is in the east.His eye looks at Bruchtal.And Saruman must have betrayed us.The list of our followers is short.His betrayal goes deeper than you know.Through lazy magic, Saruman has crossed orcs with bilwiss people.He breeds an army in the dungeons of Isengart.An army that also progresses quickly and far in the sunlight.Saruman wants to get the ring.Even the power of the Elves is not up to evil.We lack the strength to fight Mordor and Isengart!The ring can't stay here.This threat concerns the whole of Middle Earth.You must now decide how we meet her.The time of the Elves is over.My people are leaving these shores.Who will you turn to then?To the dwarfs?They are looking for wealth in the mountains.The needs of others do not care.We have to put our hope in people.Humans.People are weak.The people of the people are failing.The blood of Númenor is powerless, all his pride and dignity forgotten.The human because of the ring survives the time.I was there, Gandalf.I was there 3000 years ago. When Isildur took the ring.I was there when the strength of the people failed.Isildur, hurry!Follow me.I led Isildur to the heart of the Fate Hill, where the ring had been forged.Only there could he be destroyed. Throw him into the fire!Destroy him!At that time it should have ended, but the evil was allowed to persist.Isildur kept the ring.The line of kings is interrupted.There is no more strength in the world of men.They are scattered, disputed, unguided.Only one could unite them.One who could climb the throne of Gondor again.He left this path a long time ago.He chose exile.The bristled sword Narsil.The blade which cut the ring of Sauron's hand.She's still hot.Just a broken heirloom.Why do you fear the past?You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.You're not tied to his fate.The same blood flows through my veins.The same weakness.Your time will come.You will face the same evil.And you will defeat it.The shadow has no power yet.Neither about you nor about me.Do you remember our first encounter?I felt put into a dream.Long years have passed since then.At that time, you did not worry.Remember what I said back then?You said you would enter into the covenant with me and thereby renounce the immortality of your people.And I hold on to that.Better a single life with you than all the ages of this world alone.So I choose a mortal life.You can't give me that.You've been called here to defy Mordor's threat.Middle earth is on the verge of destruction.No one can escape it.Burn yourselves, or you'll go down.Every people is at the mercy of this fate, on prosperity and corruption.Get out the ring, Frodo.So it's true.He's a gift.A gift to the adversaries of Mordor.Why not use it?For a long time my father, the deception of Gondor, has resisted Mordor's force.With the blood of our people we defend your countries.Give Gondor the enemy's weapon.Let's use them against him.You can't use it.No one can.The One Ring obeys Sauron alone.He's the only one who can control him.And what does a forest runner understand of such things?He's more than that.This is Aragorn, Arathorn's son.You're committed to loyalty to him.So this is Isildur's legacy?And heir to the throne of Gondor.Sit down, Legolas.Gondor has no king.Gondor doesn't need a king.Aragorn is right.We can't use it.There is only one way.The ring must be destroyed.What are we waiting for?The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, Glóin's son, by any art we master.Created in the fires of the Fatesberg, it can only be destroyed there.You have to take him deep to Mordor and throw him back into the fiery chasm from which he came.One of you has to do this.You don't just walk for Mordor.Its black gates are guarded by worse than just Orcs.Evil there never sleeps.And the Great Eye is always vigilant.It is a barren wasteland, covered with fire, ash and dust.The air that you breathe is poisonous steam.You couldn't do it with 10,000 men.It's madness.Did you not hear Mr. Elrond?The ring must be destroyed.And you probably think it's you who does this!And if it fails now? If Sauron takes what belongs to him?Rather I want to die than see the ring in the hands of an elve!No one trusts an Elves!Do you not understand?While you're poking around, Sauron's power is growing!No one escapes her!You'll all be destroyed!I'll take it.I'll take the ring to Mordor.Although I don't know the way.I help you to carry the burden as long as it may be imposed on you.If I can protect you by life or death, I will.You have my sword.And you have my bow.And my axe.You determine our destiny, kid.If this is the will of the Council, Gondor will join.Mr. Frodo is not going anywhere without me.It is hardly possible to separate you, even if he is invited to a secret consultation and you are not.We'll come with you too!Or you'll have to send us home tied up in a bag.You need people with mind for this task.Search.Thing.Well, you'll get out of here, Pip.9 Companions.So be it.You form the community of the ring.Great.Where are we going?My old sword.Stitch.Take it.It's so easy.Yes.The Elves have forged it.The blade shimmers blue when orcs are nearby.And in times like this, boy, you have to be particularly careful.Here's something nice.Mithril.Light as a feather and hard as a dragon tank.Put it on.My old ring.I would very much like to hold him again - one last time.I'm sorry I put that on you.I'm sorry you're carrying this burden now.I'm sorry about everything.We have to follow the Rfad west of the Fog Mountains for 40 days.If we are lucky hold, the forte of Rohan will be open to us.From there we turn east towards Mordor.Good!Very good.Move your feet.Not bad at all, Pippin.Faster!If someone asked me for my opinion, what apparently nobody does, I would suggest, we make a detour.We could go through the mines of Moria.My cousin Balin would receive us royal.No. I would only go through Moria, I would have no other choice.To him!- For the Auenland!- Hold him tight, Merry!What's that?Just a bit of a cloud.It moves fast, though.And against the wind.Crebain from Dunland!Hide!Cover!The scouts of Sarumans.They're watching the way south.We have to take the pass of Caradhras.A strange skill makes us endure so much fear and doubt because of such a small thing.Such a little thing.Give Frodo the ring.Suit yourself.I don't care.Well, Gandalf, you're trying to guide her across the Caradhras.And if that fails, which way do you choose?When the mountain conquers you, you dare an even more dangerous path!?There are cruel voices in the air.That's Sarunam!He's bringing the mountain down.We have to turn back!No! No!We have to leave the mountain!On to the gate of Rohan! And via the West-Fold to my city.The gate of Rohan leads us too close to Isengart!We can't cross the mountain.Let's go under him.Let's go through the mines of Moria.You're afraid of these mines.The dwarfs have been too greedy and too deep.You know what they woke up in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:Shadow and flame.Let the ring bearer decide.We're going through the mines.So be it.The walls of Moria.Well, let's see.Ithildin.It only reflects starlight or moonlight.It says here: The doors of Durin, the Lord of Moria.Speak, friend, and step in.What does that mean?If you are a friend, say the slogan, and the door will open.Mines are no place for a pony.Not even for the brave Lutz.Goodbye, Lutz.Off you go.Don't worry, Sam. He knows the way home.Don't screw up the water.No, it's pointless.It's a mystery.Speak, friend and step in.What's the name of Freundauf elbisch?Mellon.Soon, Elbenherr, you get to know the famous hospitality of the dwarfs.Strolling fireplace, malt beer, well hung meat!This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.And they call it a mine.A mine!This is not a mine.It's a grave.They were Bilwiss people.To the gate of Rohan.We'd never have come here.Let's get out of here.Out!Into the mines!Legolas!Run!We have only one option left.We have to take up Moria's long darkness.Be on your guard!There are even older and meaner creatures than Orcs in the depths of the world.Shut up now.We need 4 days to the other side.Hopefully our presence remains unnoticed.That's where I don't remember.- Are we lost?I think so.Gandalf thinks about it.- What is it?- I'm hungry.There's something down there.This is Gollum.He's been following us for three days.He escaped from the dungeons of Barad-dûr?Escaped or was released.He hates and loves the ring, just as he hates and loves himself.His desire for him will never be extinguished.A pity that Bilbo didn't kill him then.It was pity that Bilbo's hand held back.Many who live, deserve death.Some who die deserve life.Can you give it to them, Frodo?Don't be so quick with a death sentence at hand.For even the wise do not recognize all intentions.My heart tells me that Gollum still has a role to play - for the good or for the bad - before everything ends.Bilbo's pity may determine the fate of many.I wish I had never gotten the ring. And all this would never have happened.That's what all who experience such times do.But they can't decide.We just have to decide what to do with the time that is given to us.There are other forces at work, not only the forces of evil.Bilbo was looking to find the ring, just as you were looking to have it.And that's an encouraging thought.That's the way.- He remembers.But here the air doesn't smell like that.In case of doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.Let me dare a little more light.Look! The great kingdom and the city dwarf beck.A true eye opener, no question.Here rests Balin, Fundin's son, Lord of Moria.So he's dead.I had feared it.We have to keep going.We can't stay.They took the bridge and the 2nd hall.We've locked the gates, but can't hold them for long.The earth trembles.Drums. Drums in depth.We can't go out.A shadow moves in the darkness.We can't go out.They're coming.Naughty Tuk!Throw yourself into it, so you don't prepare us any more trouble.Orcs.Stay behind Gandalf!They have a cave troll.Let them come!There is a dwarf in Moria who still breathes.I guess I'm starting to get the hang of it.Oh, no.He's alive.I'm all right.I'm unharmed.You should have been dead.The shock would have impaled a wild boar.There's more to this Hobbit than the eye sees.Mithril.You are full of surprises, Mr. Beutlin.To the bridge of Khazad-dûm.What is this new devilishness?A Balrog.A demon of the old world.This enemy is superior to all of you.Run!Quick!Keep them going, Aragorn.The bridge is close.Do as I say!Swords are no longer useful here.No one throws a dwarf.Not on the beard!Careful!Wait!Hold on!Bend forward!Careful.Over the bridge!Run!You can't pass!I am a servant of the Secret Fire, Master over the flame of Anor.The dark fire will do you no good, flame of Udûn!Go back into the shadows.You can't pass!Flee, you fools.No! No!Legolas, up with them.Give them some time!When it gets dark, it's teeming with orcs.We have to go to the forests of Lothlórien.Come on, Boromir.Legolas, Gimli, help them on.Get up, Sam.Stay close, young Hobbits!They say a great sorcerer lives in these woods.An elbenhexe of appalling power.All who see them, succumb to their spell.And will never be seen again.You come to us as a harbinger of fate.You bring evil to us, ring bearer.After all, here's a dwarf that she can't cover so easily.I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.Haldir of Lórien.We come to ask for help.We need your protection.These forests are dangerous!We should turn back!You have entered the kingdom of the mistress of the forest. You cannot turn back.Come on.She's waiting for you.Here are 8. 9 have broken from Bruchtal.Tell me, where is Gandalf?Because it requires me very much to talk to him.He fell into the shadows.Your ride is on knife's edge.Only a few fail, and it will fail, which means the demise of all.And yet there is hope as long as the community is faithful.Don't let your heart be hard on you.You shall rest, you are exhausted after so much grief and plague.Tonight you sleep in peace...Welcome, Frodo from the Auenland, who has seen the eye.A lament for Gandalf.What do they say about him?My heart cannot translate.For me, the grief is still too close.Sleep a little.These boundaries are well protected.I can't sleep here.I heard her voice in my head.She spoke of my father and the case of Gondor.She said: Even now there is still hope.But I don't see them.It's been a long time since we hoped.My father is a noble man, but a weak ruler, and our... our people lose confidence.I'm supposed to turn everything for the good for him. I would.I would lead Gondor back into the light.Have you ever seen him, Aragorn?The White Tower of Ecthelions?Glittering like a thorn of pearls and silver.Its banners, shining in the morning wind.Have you ever heard the bright sound of silver trumpets?I saw the White City a long time ago.One day our way will lead us there.And from the tower the call will sound:The Lords Gondors have returned.Are you looking in the mirror?What am I going to see?That even the wisest doesn't always know, because the mirror shows many things.Things that were. Things that are. And things,I know what you saw.I perceive the same thing.The thing that will happen when you fail.The Community is disintegrating.It has already begun.He will try to take him.You know who I'm talking about.One by one he will destroy them all.If you ask him, I will give you the One Ring.You give it to me voluntarily?I do not deny that my heart has desired this very much.Instead of a Dark Ruler you would have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and appalling as the morning!Tricky as the sea!Stronger than the earth's foundations!Everyone will love me and despair.I pass the exam.I'm gonna get weaker and go to the Westand Galadriel remain.I can't do this alone.You're a ring bearer, Frodo.To wear a ring means to be alone.This task is for you.And if you can't find a way, no one will find it.Then I know what I have to do.It's just - I'm afraid of it.Even the smallest can change the course of fate.Do you know how the Orcs saw the light of day?They were once elves, but they were tortured and mutilated by the Dark Forces.A destroyed and terrible life form that nowis completed.My fighting Uruk-hai! Who do you serve?Saruman.Hunt them!Until you find her!You know neither fear nor pain.You will taste human flesh!One of the half-lings carries something very valuable.Bring them to me alive and unharmed.Kill the others.I give you the light of Eärendil, our beloved star.May it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out.The Argonath.Finally I see the kings of the ancient forefathers.My ancestors.We cross the lake at night, hide the boats and hike further.We're approaching Mordor from the north.So we just have to fight through the Emyn Muil, a maze of razor-sharp rocks.And after that it gets even better!Schwärende, stinking swamp landscape, as far as the eye can see.This is our way.Sleep a little and recover, Mr. Dwarf.Refresh!Let's get out of here.No. No.Orcs guard the eastern shore.Let's wait until it's dark.I'm not worried about the east bank.A menacing shadow seizes mine.Something's coming up.I can feel it.A dwarf doesn't have to recover.Just don't mind, young Hobbit.Where's Frodo?No one should be alone.Especially you.So much depends on you.I know why you're looking for loneliness.You're tormenting yourself.I see it day after day.Don't you feel unnecessarily tormented?There are other ways, Frodo.Other paths we can choose.I know what you're saying.It would be wise, my heart did not warn me.Did you warn?From what?We're all scared, Frodo.But by fear of destroying the few in hope, is madness.There is no other way.I just want the strength to defend my people!Can you lend me the ring...No! No!I'm not a thief.You're not yourself.What prospects do you have?They'll find you.You take the ring.And you will beg for death!Son of a bitch!An unfortunate coincidence gave it to you!He could have been mine.He should be mine!Give it to me!- Give me that!- No, I'm not.I know what you have in mind.You want to bring Sauron the ring!You want to betray us!You run into death's arms and bring it over all of us!I curse you!You and all the halflings!What have I done?Please, Frodo.Frodo, I'm sorry!He took possession of Boromirs.Where's the ring?Stay away!I swore to protect you.Even in front of yourself?Would you destroy him?I would have gone with you to the end.All the way to Mordor's fire.I know.Take care of the others.Especially Sam.He won't understand.Go, Frodo.Run!Find the halflings!Aragorn, run!Hide here!Come on!What's he up to?He's leaving us.No! No!Run, Frodo.Hey, you guys!Here we are!Here!It's working!I can see that!The Horn of Gondor.Run!You have the little ones!Hold still.Where's Frodo?I let him move.You did what I couldn't.I wanted to take the ring away from him.The ring is now unattainable.Forgive me.I couldn't have guessed.I betrayed you all.No, Boromir.You fought bravely.You've kept your honor.Don't.It's over.The world of men will perish.Everything sinks into darkness. My city falls into ruins.I don't know what power I have, but I swear to you, neither falls the White City, nor fails our people.Our people.I would have followed you, my brother.My captain.My King.Peace be with you, son of Gondor.I wish I never had the ring.And all this would never have happened.That's what all those who experience such times do. But they can't decide.You just have to decide what you start with the time that is given to you.Frodo, don't!No, Sam.Go back, Sam!I'm going to Mordor alone.Of course.And I'm coming with you!You can't swim!I promised, Mr. Frodo.I promise.Don't lose him, Samweis Gamjie.And I won't.I won't.Come on.Quick!Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.You don't want to follow them.Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.Then everything was for nothing.The Community has failed.Not if we stick together faithfully.We don't leave Merry and Pippin to torture and death.Not as long as we still have power.Leave everything you need here.Just light luggage.Let's hunt Orcs.May the others find a safer way.Streicher will take care of her.We'll probably never see her again.Perhaps still, Mr. Frodo.Maybe it is.I'm glad you're with me.You can't pass!Gandalf!I am the servant of the Secret Fire, master of the flame of Anor.Back in the shadows!The dark fire will do you no good, flame of Udûn!You can't pass!No! No!No! No!Gandalf!Flee, you fools!No! No!Gandalf!Gandalf!What's wrong with you, Mr. Frodo?Nothing.I was just dreaming.Can you see the floor?No, don't look down, Sam!Just keep climbing!Catch it!Pick up, Mr. Frodo!Mr Frodo!I think I found the ground.Swamps and ropes and knows the cuckoo, what else.That's not natural.None of this!- What's in there?- Nothing. It's a bit of a spice.In case we eat a roast chicken or something.A roast chicken?You never know.Sam, my good Sam!That's something very special.The best salt in all of Auenland.It's really something special.A piece of home.We can't leave this here, someone could follow us down.Who should follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?Really a pity, Mrs. Galadriel gave it to me.Real Elves Rope.Well, there's nothing you can do.The knot comes from me.I'm sure it won't work that fast.Real, real elve rope.Mordor!The only place in Middle Earth that we don't want to see from close.And that's exactly the place we're looking to get to!But we can't get there.Let's not fool ourselves, Mr. Frodo. We're lost.I don't think Gandalf had planned this path for us.There's a lot that he didn't plan, Sam. But it happened.Mr Frodo?It's the ring, isn't it?He's getting harder and harder.- What else do we have in food?- Let's take a look.Oh, yeah, delicious!Lembas bread.And the greatest...More Lembas bread.I don't really like foreign cuisine like that, but this from the Elves is not bad.Nothing can cloud your mood, can't it, Sam?At most the rain clouds.Somehow this seems familiar.Because we've been here before.We're walking around in circles.What a horrible stench!Here nearby must be a disgusting moor.Do you smell that?Yes, I smell it.We're not alone.The thieves.The thieves!The dirty little thieves!Where is he?They stole it from us, my dear.Damn them, we hate them!He is ours, yes, and we want him!That's stab. You've seen it before.Am I right, Gollum?Let him go right now or I'll cut your throat.It's burning!It burns us!It's freezing!Garstige elves have turned it together.- Take it off us!- Shut up!It's hopeless!Every orc in all Mordor will hear this outcry!We tie him up and then leave him here.No, no, this will kill us, kill us!You don't deserve anything else!Maybe he really deserved death.But now that I see him, I feel sorry for him.We'll be nice to them if they're nice to us.Take it off us!We promise to do what you want from us.We promise's!You can't make a promise I can rely on.We swear! We will serve him, the Lord of the Treasure!We will swear on... on... on the treasure.Gollum.Gollum.The ring is treacherous.So stick to your word!Yes. To the treasure.To the treasure.I don't believe you!- Come down!- Sam!He's just trying to trick us!If we let him go, he'll strangle us in our sleep!- You know the way to Mordor?- Yes.You've been there before?Yes.Then you will lead us to the Black Gate.To the gate!To the gate, says the Lord!Yes!We don't want to go back!Not there.Not to him!They can't force us.Gollum!Gollum!But we have sworn to serve the Lord of the Treasure.No! No!Ash and dust and thirst is there. And caves, caves, caves!And orcs! Thousands of orcs!And always the Great Eye, alert and alert.Come back now!Come back!There!What did I tell you?He ran away, that crook!So much for his promises!This way, Hobbits, follow me!Follow me!Merry!Merry!You're late.Our Lord becomes impatient.He wants the Auenland rats now.I don't follow orders from Orkmaden!Saruman will get his booty.We will deliver them.Merry!Merry!Wake up!My friend is sick.He needs water.Please!Is he sick?Then he gets a little medicine, boys.Stop it!Can't take his train!- Leave him alone!- How?Do you want something?Then shut up.Merry.Hello, Pip.- Are you all right?- I'm all right.- I was just pretending.- Is that what you've done?See?You fell for it, too.Don't worry about me, Pippin.What's going on?What do you smell?Human flesh.They're on our trail.Aragorn.Go on!They march faster.They must've weathered us.Quick!Come on, Gimli!3 days and nights we follow them.Without food.Without rest.And no sign of those we seek, except naked stone.Not without purpose do Lórien's leaves fall!Then maybe they're still alive.And at most one day's march ahead.Come on!Come on, Gimli!We'll catch them up!I'm not needed to be cross-country.We Dwarves are more born Spurter.Murder dangerous over short distances.Rohan.Home of the horsemen.Strange things are at work here.Something evil gives these creatures speed and directs his will against us.Legolas!What does your Elbe Eye see?Their trail leads to the north-west.The Uruks bring the Hobbits to Isengart!Saruman.The world is changing.Who is still standing up against the army of Isengart and Mordor?Who stands up against the power of Sauron and Saruman and against the alliance of the two towers?Together, Sauron, my master, we will reign over Middle Earth.The Old World will burn in the fires of the melting furnaces.The forests will fall.A new order will emerge.We will drive the war machine with sword and spear and the iron fist of the orcs.I want to see her armed and ready to march in two weeks.But, my lord, there are too many.Until then, not all can be armed. We do not have the means.Build a dam, stave the river, heat the ovens day and night!We lack fuel, so many furnaces to heat.The forest of Fangorn is at our door.- Burn it down.We fight for you.Swear!Let's go to death for Saruman!The horsemen took your land!Your people were chased into the mountains and now live on barren rock.Killer!Get back what you've been stolen! Burn everything down!We just have to eliminate those who are against us.In Rohan it will begin.The farmers there have resisted you for too long.This has now come to an end.Éothain!Éothain!You take your sister.You're moving faster if you're just two.Papa has forbidden Éothain to ride on Gárulf.He's too big for him!Listen to me!You have to ride to Edoras and sound the alarm.- Do you understand what I'm saying?- Yes, Mama.I don't want to leave.I don't want to leave here, Mama!Freda, I will soon follow.Quick!Ride, child!Rohan, my lord, is on the verge of the case.Théodred.Seek the King's son!- Mordor will pay for it with blood.- These orcs aren't from Mordor.My Mr. Éomer, over here!He's alive.Théodred.Your son is severely wounded, my lord.He was attacked by Orks.If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it forcibly.That's a lie.Saruman the White has always been our friend and ally, all over and ever since.Gríma.Gríma.Gríma.Orcs now roam freely through our country, undisturbed, unpunished, arbitrarily murdering.Orcs with the sign of the white hand of Saruman.Why are you complaining with worries about his already worried mind?Don't you see?Your uncle suffers greatly from your dissatisfaction and warmongering.War-triggering?How long has it been since Saruman bought you?What was the promised price, Gríma?Your part of the loot, as well as all are eliminated?You've been watching my sister for too long.You've been watching her steps for too long.You see a lot, Éomer, Éomund's son.Too much.From now on you are banished from the kingdom of Rohan and all its dominions. If you return, you are threatened with death.You have no authority here.Your orders don't mean anything.Well, you're wrong, this is not an order from me.He's from the King.He signed it this morning.Keep breathing.That's the trick. Breathe!Breathe!They run as if the whips of their masters were behind them!SARK 1: We'll go on only when we've taken a breather.Kick a fire, let's go!Merry!Merry!I think it was a mistake of us to leave the Auenland, Pippin.What are those noises?- Those are the trees.Do you remember the Old Forest, on the border with Bockland?Previously it was said that there was something in the water that makes the trees grow up and even makes them alive.Live?Trees that whisper, talk to each other and even move.I'm starving.Only this big bread and that for 3 stinking days!Yes!Why don't we get meat here?How about them?They're fresh.They're not there to eat.What about her legs?They don't need them.- Oh, they look delicious!Back up, you worm!The prisoners go to Saruman.Live and unharmed.Live?Why alive?Can you play with them?You have something with you.An elbian weapon.The Lord needs them for war.- You think we have the ring.- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,If they find out that we don't have him, we're dead.Chop them into pieces! Just a bite!From now on there is meat again on the menu.Pippin!Come on, come on!Go on!Why don't you call for help?Quiekt!Now no one will be able to save you.Pippin!A red sun rises.Blood was spilled tonight.Your rider from Rohan, what's new in the Mark?What do an elb, a man and a dwarf do here in the Riddermark?Speak quickly!Give me your name, horse lord, then I will call you mine.I'd cut your head off, dwarf, if he just stood a little higher above the ground.You would die before you made out for pranks.I'm Aragorn, Arathorn's son.This is Gimli, Glóin's son, and Legolas from the Waldlandreich.We are friends of Rohan and Théoden, your king.Théoden can no longer distinguish friend from enemy.Even his kinship he does not recognize.Saruman has poisoned the spirit of the king and demands the rule of this land.My squad consists of those who are faithful to Rohan.And for that we were banished.The White Wizard is listy.He appears here and there, it is said, as an old man in hood and coat.And everywhere his snitches slip through our nets.We're not a snitch.We track a group of Uruk-hai westwards across the plain.You have captured two of our friends.The Uruks are destroyed.We killed everyone at night.But there were 2 hobbits!Have you seen two hobbits among them?They would have been small, only children in your eyes.We didn't let anyone live.We put the carcasses on a pile and burned them.You're dead?I'm sorry.Hasufel!Arod!May these horses meet you with a better skill than their last masters.Farewell.Look for your friends.But make you no hope.It's lost in these lands.We ride north!That's one of their belts.We've let them down.A Hobbit lay here.And here's the other one.They crawled.Her hands were tied.The shackles were cut.Then they ran this way.They were persecuted.The belt!Run.The tracks lead away from the battle. To the Fangorn forest.Fangorn?What madness did she drive in there?Did we lose him?I think so, don't I?I'll rip out your crappy little guts!Come here!Trees.On a tree, Pippin!He's gone.Merry!Now I'm drilling maggot holes in your mouth!Run, Merry!Little Orcs, burárum!He speaks, Merry.The tree speaks!Tree?I'm not a tree!I'm a duck.A tree herd.A shepherd of the forest.Don't talk to him, Merry!Don't challenge him.Treebeard some call me.And whose side are you on?Page?I am on the side of no one. Because no one is on my side, little orc.No one cares about the forest.We're not orcs.We're hobbits!Hobbits?I've never heard of a Hobbit.Sounds to me like Ork-Teufelei.They come with fire.They come with axes.Nagging, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!Destroyer, invaders!Curse over them!You don't quite understand.We're hobbits!Halflings!Auenland residents!Maybe you are and maybe you are not.The White Wizard will know.The White Wizard?Saruman.Look!Look!We've guided you!Hurry, Hobbitse.Hurry up!Great luck that we found you.Nice Hobbit.Oh!A moor!He led us into a swamp.A swamp. Yes, yes.Come on, Lord.We'll take you on safe paths through the fog.Come on, Hobbits!Come on!We're going fast.I found him.Yes.The way through the swamps.Orcs don't use it.Orcs don't know him.You walk miles and miles around it.Come on, quick!Quiet and fast like shadows we must be.I hate this place.Much too quiet here.For 2 days no bird neither to see nor to hear.No, no birds to eat.No crispy birds!We must starve, yes.We must starve, my dear.Here.What is it that they eat?Is it... does it taste, yes?He's trying to suffocate us!We can't eat Hobbit food.We must starve to death!Then starve to death.Then we finally got rid of you.Oh, cruel Hobbit!He doesn't care if we're hungry.He doesn't care if we have to die.Unlike the Lord.The Lord cares.The Lord knows.Yes.My darling.Once he takes possession of us, he never lets you go again.Don't touch me!There's dead people!Dead faces in the water!All dead.All rotted.Elves and people and orcs.A mighty battle. Long ago.The swamps of the dead.Yes, yes, that's her name.This way.Don't follow the lights.Otherwise Hobbits go down to the dead and also light small candles.Look out!Frodo!Gollum?Don't follow the lights!Gollum!- Mr. Frodo!Are you all right?So beautiful.So magnificent.Oh, my darling...What did you say?Lord should sleep now.Lord must remain strong.- Who are you?- Can't ask us.None of his business.Gollum!Gollum!Gandalf said you were one of the river people.Cold be hand, heart and bone. Cold, who travels far from home.He said your life was a sad story.He no longer sees what lies ahead of him, When Sonn'and Moon's light dwindles.You were once not so dissimilar to a Hobbit, were you?Sméagol.What does it call me?That used to be your name, right?Very long ago.My name.Sméagol.- Black riders!Hide!Come on, Frodo!Come on!Quick!Or they'll see us!See us!- I thought they were dead!- Dead?No, you can't kill them. Impossible.Ghosts!Ghosts with wings!They're calling for it.They're calling for the treasure.Mr. Frodo, don't be afraid!I'm here.Hurry, Hobbits.The Black Gate is very close.Orc blood.These are strange traces.The air is so stuffy here.This forest is old.Very old.Full of memories and anger.The trees, they talk to each other.Gimli!Set your axe!You have feelings, my friend.It was the Elves once...They have awakened the trees and taught them to speak.Talking trees!What could trees talk about, huh?Except for the nature of squirrels.There's something out there.What do you see?The White Wizard, he's approaching.You must not let him speak, otherwise his spell blinds us.We need to be quick.You're tracking the tracks of two young hobbits.Where are they?You got through here. Yesterday.They met someone they hadn't expected.Is that comforting?Who are you?Show yourself!That's impossible!Forgive me.I thought you were Saruman.I'm Saruman.More likely, Saruman, as he should be.You fell!By fire... and water.From the deepest dungeon to the highest peak I fought against the Balrog of Morgoth.Until I finally threw down my enemy and smashed his shell against the side of the mountain.Then darkness surrounded me and I wandered around without thought and time.Above me the stars went and every day was as long as an age on earth.But it wasn't the end.Because life moved back inside me.I was sent back until my task is accomplished.Gandalf.Gandalf?Yes...That's what they used to call me.Gandalf, the Grey.That was my name.Gandalf!I'm Gandalf, the White.And I will return to you at the turning point of the tides.One stage of your journey is over, now follow the next.War has come over Rohan.We have to ride to Edoras, as fast as we can.To Edoras?This is not a small distance.We heard nothing good from Rohan.It's bad for the king.Yes, and he won't be easy to cure.Just say we walked all the way for nothing?Should we leave poor Hobbits here in this gruesome, dark, dull, tree-contaminated...?I meant, wonderful, quite wonderful forest?It was more than mere coincidence that led Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.Many years has been slumbering here a great power.The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones, which initiates an avalanche in the mountains.In one point you have not changed, dear friend.- Hmm?- You're still talking in riddles.Something is about to happen that hasn't happened since the ancient times.The ducks will wake up- and realize that they are strong.- Strong?Oh, that's good.So stop the nuisance, Mr. Dwarf!Merry and Pippin are safe.In fact, it's a lot more than you'll be soon.This new Gandalf is even more grumpy than the old one.This is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are deceived by a spell.Shadow fur.He is the prince of all Roesers and by many dangers a faithful friend to me.Eberesche, myBright test once in appearanceThe summer wonderfulOn your head hold A red and goldSo you carried up the crownWhat a beautiful verse.- Is it still very far?- Bararum.Don't be so hasty.You may call it far.My home lies deep in the forest, close to the roots of the mountain.I promised Gandalf that nothing will happen to you and what I promise will happen.I think you'll like the next one too.It's a self-composition.So...Dreaming the leaves In the canopySleeping bork, branch and branchWhen shady moss is green and coolAnd the west wind invitesHow I miss youHow I miss youAnd say this country is mine.Oh.Sleeps, small foreigners.Don't hear a nightly sound.Sleeps until morning light.I have to do now in the forest.It is necessary to call many.Many who have to come.A shadow lies on Fangorn.The withering of all forests is approaching.The threatening shadow that lurks in the east is now taking shape.Sauron won't tolerate a rival.From the height of Barad-dür, his eye keeps waking.But he is not yet so powerful that he is exalted above fear.Ever the doubt of him gnaws.He heard rumors.The legacy of Númenor is alive.Sauron fears you, Aragorn.He fears what you might become.That is why he will strike quickly against the world of men.He will use Sarumans to destroy Rohan.There will be war.Rohan must defend himself and this is our first challenge. Because Rohan is weak and is on the verge of the case.The king's thoughts are enslaved. A very old trick of Saruman.His influence on King Théoden is now very strong.Sauron and Saruman now pull the noose.But as cunning as they may be, we have an advantage.The ring remains hidden.And that we could try to destroy him, that they do not imagine themselves even in their darkest dreams.And so the enemy's weapon moves to Mordor.In the hand of a hobbit she gets closer to the flames of the Fatesberg with every day.We have to trust Frodo now.Everything depends on him making rapid progress and keeping his undertaking secret.You must not regret having left him.He alone must complete this task.He's not alone.Sam's with him.Oh, really?Oh, really?Good.Yes. Very good.The Black Gate of Mordor.Oh, stand by us.My old ohm would have a lot to say if he could see us now.The Lord has said, show him the way to Mordor.The good Sméagol does. The Lord has said's.You're right.Well, that's it, then.We'll never get through that.Look!The gate!It's opening!There's a way down here.Sam, no!My lord!- You don't have to come with me, Sam.- I know, Mr. Frodo.Even our elve coats won't be able to protect us in there.- Now!No! No!No, sir!They'll get you!They'll get you!Don't take him to him.He wants it, the treasure.He's always been looking for it.And the treasure absolutely wants to go back to him.But we can't let him get the treasure.No! No!There is another way!A more secret.A dark path.- And why didn't you talk about it before?- Because the Lord didn't ask anything.He's up to something.You say there's another way to Mordor?There is a path and stairs.And then a tunnel.- He's taken us so far, Sam.- Mr. Frodo, no!But he swore an oath.No. No.Show us the way, Sméagol.Good Sméagol always helps.Hello?Treebeard?Where did he go?I had a wonderful dream tonight.From such a big barrel full of pipe herb.And we smoked everything away.And then you got sick.What would I give now for a train old Tobi.Did you hear that?There it was again.Something's wrong here.And what's wrong with this?You just said something in Baumisch.No, not at all.I was just stretching.You're taller!Who?You!- As what?- When I did!I've always been taller than you.Pippin, that really everyone knows, I'm the big one and you're the little one.Please, Merry!How tall are you?3 ft 6?At most.Whereas I am almost 3 ft 7.3 ft 8!3 ft 8.You did something.Merry, you...M... D...Merry!No, tree beard has said, you can't drink from it!I want something, too!- He said it could be dangerous!Come on, give it to me!Merry!What's happening?It's got my leg!Merry!No! No!Help!Get away from me!You shouldn't be awake.Eat earth.Dig deep.Drink water.Go to sleep.Go on with you.Come. The forest is on awakening.It's not safe here.The trees have become wild and dangerous.Anger ferments in their hearts.Black are their thoughts.Strong is their hatred.They are evil if they can.Oh, there are too few of us Ents.Too few to deal with them.If you've lived so long, why are there so few of you?- Are there any de-children?- Burárum.Enttings has not existed for a long number of years.- Why not?- We've lost the dews.I'm sorry about that.- How did they die?- Died?No! No!We lost her.And now we can't find them again.You didn't happen to see dews in the Auenland?I can't honestly say that.You, Pip?What do they look like?Um, I can't remember now.Edoras and the Golden Hall Meduseld.There lives Théoden, King of Rohan, whose spirit is broken.Saruman's influence on King Théoden is now very strong.My lord, your son, he is dead.My lord?Uncle?Aren't you going to see him?Don't you want to do anything?Be careful what you say.Don't expect you to be welcome here.He must be different over the night.How tragic for the king to lose the only son and heir.I know, such farewell is not easy to accept.Especially now that your brother has let you down.Leave me alone, snake!But you are alone.Who knows what you entrust to the darkness, in the bitter hours of the night, when your whole existence seems to shrink,To you the walls of your chamber approaching, locked in a cage like wild beast.So nice, so cool...Like a pale morning in spring, still breathed through by winter cold.Your words are like poison.At each cemetery the mood is more cheerful.Ah!I cannot let you be so armed to King Théoden, Gandalf Grey Skirt.At the behest of Gríma snake tongue.- Your staff.- Hmm?Oh...You don't want to take his support from an old man, do you?My master, Gandalf, the Grey, has arrived.He is a harbinger of suffering.The courtesy in your hall has lately diminished somewhat, Théoden King.He's not welcome.Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Storm crows?This is a very legitimate question, Lord and Master.Late is the hour in which this magician enters the plan.Láthspell should be called him!Bad news is a bad guest.Shut up!Keep your split tongue behind your teeth.I didn't go through fire and death and now I'm changing lying words with a simple worm.His staff!I have ordered you to take off the wizard's staff!Théoden, Thengel's son! You've been sitting in the shade for too long.If I were you, I wouldn't move right now.Listen to me!I release you from the spell.You have no power here, Gandalf, the Grey.I'll suck you out of Saruman like poison from a wound.Wait!When I go, Théoden dies.You didn't kill me, you won't kill him either.Rohan is mine.Soft!I know your face.Éowyn.Éowyn.Gandalf?Now breathe the fresh air again, my friend.Dark have been my dreams lately.Your fingers would better remember their old power if they grabbed your sword.I have always served only you, my lord!Your creative healing would have almost made me crawl on all fours like an animal!Don't send me from your side.No, sir!Let him go.Enough blood has already been shed because of him.Get out of my way!Salvation, Théoden, King!Where's Théodred?Where's my son?Simbelmynë.It has always grown on the hills of my ancestors.Now it shall cover my son's grave.Oh, that these dark days must be mine.The boys die and the old ones remain.That I'm still alive and see the last days of my house.You're not to blame for Théodred's death.No father should carry his child to his grave.He was strong in life.His soul will find the way into the halls of your fathers.They were not warned, were unarmed.Now wild people go through the Westfold and burn everything down.Stall, Schober and Tree.- Where's Mama?Shh...This is just a foretaste of the horror that Saruman evokes.The horror is even more effective, because Saruman is driven by the fear of Sauron.Ride and offer him the forehead.Lock him away from your wives and children.You must fight!You have 2000 capable men riding north at this moment.Éomer is loyal to you.They will return and fight for their king.You'll be 300 miles from here by now.Éomer can't help us.I know what you expect of me, but I don't want any increased suffering among my people.I don't want to risk an open war.Open war is ahead of you whether you want to risk it or not.As far as I can remember, Théoden, not Aragorn, was King of Rohan.And what is the king's decision?HÁWe seek refuge in Helm's gorge.Do not load yourselves with treasures.Only the most necessary take with you on supplies.Helm's clamp!They flee to the mountains, although they should stay here and fight.Who will defend them, if not their king?He only does what he considers to be the best for his people.Helms Klamm has saved her before.There is no way out of this gorge.Théoden runs into a trap.He believes to bring his people to safety.But it will end in a carnage.Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.I fear for Rohan's survival.He'll need you before the end, Aragorn.The Rohan people will need you.Your defense must stand firm.She'll hold.The Grey Pilgrim, that's what they once called me.Since 300 human lives I am already on this earth and now I have no time.With a little luck, my search will not be for nothing.Expect my coming at the first light of the fifth day.At sunrise looks east.Go on.The stallion is foolish, sir.It's pointless.His name is Brego.He was my cousin's horse.Brego?Your name is royal.I have heard of the magic arts of the elves. But I would not have expected them with a forest runner from the north.You speak like one of yours.As a child I lived in Bruchtal. For a while.Clear this one.He's seen enough of the war.Gandalf, the white man!Gandalf, the fool!Is he trying to humiliate me with his newly discovered piety?There were 3 who followed the sorcerer.An elb, a dwarf and a man.You smell like a horse.The human being...Was he from Gondor?No, from the north.Probably one of the Dúnedain forest runners, so it seemed to me.Poorly dressed.And yet, he wore a strange ring.2 snakes with emerald eyes.One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.Barahir's ring.Then Gandalf Graurock believes to have found Isildur's inheritance.The missing King Gondor.He's a fool.This sex was extinguished years ago.That's insignificant.The world of men will perish.It will begin in Edoras.I'm ready, Gamling.Bring me my horse.This will not defeat.We will return.We will return.You are skillful with the sword.The women of Rohan have learned that those without swords can still die by a sword.I fear neither death nor pain.Then what do you fear, Mistress?A cage.To stay behind bars, until habit and old age accept it and all prospects to accomplish great deeds, irrevocable are gone.You are a daughter of kings. A shieldmaid Rohans.I don't think this will be your destiny.Théoden won't stay in Edoras.It's vulnerable.He knows that.He'll expect an attack on the city.They flee to Helm's gorge, the great fortress of Rohan.It is a dangerous path that you take through the mountains.They'll be slow.They will have women and children with them.Send out your Warg-riders!Hey, stinker! Don't go too far ahead.- Why are you doing this?- What?You insult him.Give him horrible names.It's simple.Because that's exactly what he is, Mr. Frodo.There is nothing left in him but lies and betrayals.He's after the ring.He doesn't care about anything else.You do not know how he has suffered under the ring. As he still suffers from it.- I want to help him, Sam.- Why?He must be able to be the one he was again.You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.What do you know about that?Nothing!Sorry, Sam.I don't know why I said that.I do.It's the ring.You only have eyes for him!I've been watching you.You don't eat anything.Don't tell me you're asleep.He has taken possession of you, Mr. Frodo. Fight it!I know what I have to do, Sam.The ring has been entrusted to me.That's my job!Mine.Mine alone!Do you hear yourself talking?Do you know how you sound?We want him.We need him.We must have him, the treasure.They stole the treasure from us.Cheerful little Hobbitse.Bad.Tricky.Wrong!No. No.No, the Lord.Yes, my darling.Wrong!They cheat you, hurt you, lie!The Lord is my friend.You don't have any friends.Nobody likes you!I'm not listening.I'm not listening!You're a liar and a thief.No. No.Killer!Go away!You want me to go away?I hate you!Where would you be without me?Gollum!Gollum!I saved us!I did it.We survived. Just because of me!This is over now.What did you say?The Lord now takes care of us.We don't need you.What?Get out of here and never come back!No. No.Get out of here and never come back!Get out of here and never come back!We told him to leave!And he's gone, my darling!Move!Move!Move!Sméagol is free!Look!Look!Look what Sméagol finds!You're young.They're tender.You're nice!Yes, they are.Eat them.Eat them!You're making him sick with your behavior.You can only eat rabbits in one way anyway.What's it doing?Stupid fat Hobbit!It spoils them!What are you going to spoil?There's no meat on them anyway.What would I give for a few vents.What are fantasies, my dear?What are Ventilations?Hmm?Kar-tof-feln.You cook them, stamp them, put them in the soup.Delicious, frying, golden frying potatoes and a piece of baked fish.Not even one like you could say no to it.Oh, yes, we could.Broke the nice fish.Give it to us, raw and zapping.Keep some fried potatoes!I give it up.Mr. Frodo, where are you?Who are they?Bad people.Servant of Sauron.They call for Mordor.The Dark engulfs all armies.Won't be long now.He'll be ready soon.Ready for what?Ready for his war.The last war that will cover the whole world with shadows.We should go on now.Come on, Sam.Mr Frodo!There!Olifants!No one will believe us at home.Sméagol?We stayed here far too long.Come on, Sam.No! No!Wait!We're innocent walkers!There are no hikers in this country.Only the servants of the Dark Tower.We are committed to a secret order.Those who claim to be against the enemy would do well not to stop us.The enemy?His sense of duty was in no way inferior to yours, I mean.One wonders what his name was and where he came from.Whether he really had a bad heart.What lies or threats have led him to the long march out of his home country.Whether he would not have preferred to stay there. in peace.The war makes corpses of all of us.Tie their hands.It's true, many dwarf women you don't see.In addition, they are so similar to us in voice and appearance that they are often thought to be male dwarfs.That's because of the beards.And from that again the fallacy arose, that there are no dwarf women at all. And that dwarfs just slip out of earthholes! Which is of course ridiculous.It's okay, it's okay.Just don't panic.That was intentional.That was intentional.It's been a long time since I saw my niece smile.She was still a child when her father was brought home dead, killed by orcs.She watched her mother break in grief.Then she was alone and used her king with growing fear.For that damned to take care of an old man who should have loved her like a father.Gimli.Uh, no, that's...Thank you.I made a stew.It's not much, but it's hot.Thank you.- All right.- Really?My uncle told me something strange.He said you went to war, with Thengel, my grandfather.But he must be wrong, I think.The King's memory is good.He was still a little kid back then.Then you must be at least 60.70?You can't be 80!87.You're one of the Dúnedain.A descendant of the Númenor, who are blessed with long life.It is said that your sex has entered the realm of legend.Only a few of us are left.The Northern Kingdom was destroyed a long time ago.I'm sorry.Please, eat.The light of the evening star does not increase or decrease.It's mine, so I can give it to whoever I want.Like my heart.Sleep now.I'm sleeping.This is a dream.Then it's a good dream.Sleep.You once told me that this day will come.This is not the end, it is the beginning.You have to go with Frodo.This is your way.My path is hidden from me.He's already laid at your feet.Finally, don't hesitate.Arwen... If you trust nothing else, trust this,Where is she?The woman who once gave you this jewel?Our time here is over.And even Arwen's time is running out.Let her go.Let them sail west with the ship.Let her take your love with her to the Immortal Lands, where she stays forever young.But nothing more than memory.I won't let Arwen die here.- She only stays here because she still has hope.- She's staying because of you.But she is one of her people.And so you're going to say goodbye now?Did you think you could sneak away unnoticed at dawn?I will not return.You underestimate your war fortune.You will return.I'm not talking about death on the battlefield.Then what are you talking about?You have the prospect of a different life, far from war, grief, despair.Why do you say that?I'm mortal.You Elbian blood.It was a dream, Arwen.Nothing more.I don't believe you.It's yours.It was a gift.Keep it.My lord?She sails to the Immortal Lands, with all who are left of her people.What is it?- Háma?- I'm not sure.Warge!A scout!- What did you see?- Warge!They're attacking us!All riders to the top of the train!Come on, lift me up.I'm a rider.Come on, let's go!You have to lead the people to Helm's gorge and quickly!- I can fight!- No, no, no, no, no.You have to do this for me.Follow me!Hey!Forward!I mean, storm forward!Run into the valley!All right!Come on!Stay together!My axe is waiting for your face!He's on my bill!Stinking creature!Aragorn!Aragorn?Tell me what happened, then I will ease your farewell.He's dead.He just fell off the cliff over there.You're lying!The wounded on the horses.The wolves Isengarts will return.Leave the dead here.Come on.Finally there!Helm's clamp!We did it.We're safe, Mistress!Mom!Éothain!Freda!- Where's the rest?- That's all we could take, Mistress.Well, get everything into the caves.Make room for the king!Make room for Théoden!Make room for the king.So few.So few have returned.Our people are safe.We have paid with many lives for it.Mistress.Mr. Aragorn... where is he?He fell.Pull all our forces behind the wall!Lock the gate!Set up posts!What happens to those who cannot fight, my master?With the women and children?Take her to the caves.Saruman's arm must indeed have become long, if he thinks we can reach us here.Helms Klamm has a weak spot.Its outer wall is made of solid stone. But there is a small passage further down, hardly more than a drain shaft.How?How does fire destroy stone?What elixir is capable of bringing down the wall?If the wall is breached, Helms Klamm falls.Even if you break it through, an unimaginable number would be needed, thousands to storm the fortress.Tens of thousands.But, my lord, there is no such force.A new power rises.And their victory is near!Tonight the land is stained with Rohan's blood!Let's go to Helms Klamm!Don't let anyone live!Forward!There is no tomorrow for humanity.Look!In the south, smoke rises!Well, there's always smoke rising from Isengart these days.In the past, Saruman often wandered in my forests.Now he only has metal and wheels in mind.He no longer cares about growing creatures.What's that?This is Saruman's force.The war has begun.May the favor of the Valar protect you.Brego.Arwen.It's time.The ships sail to Valinor.Go now before it's too late.I've made my choice.He will not return to you.Why are you still here when there's no hope?There is still hope.If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be separated.If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn is king and everything you hoped for has been fulfilled, he will nevertheless experience bitterly the lot of mortality.Whether by the sword or slow decay, one day Aragorn dies.And there will be no consolation for you, no consolation, to relieve the pain of his vagina.He will come to death. An image of all the splendor of the human kings in their unclouded splendor before the world broke apart.But you, my daughter, you will continue to dawn in the dark and in doubt, like the winter night sky without star.Here you will live your existence, bound to grief under dwindling trees. So long until the world changes and all your years of life is spent.Arwen.There's nothing here for you, just death.Don't I own your love too?You own my love, Father.The power of the enemy is growing.Sauron uses Saruman as a puppet to destroy the Rohan people.Isengart was unleashed.The eye of Sauron is now directed to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men.His war against this country will come up quickly.He feels that the ring is close.The force of the ring bearer is fading.Deep in his heart Frodo begins to understand that the task demands his life.You know that.You have foreseen it.We have all taken this risk.In the approaching darkness the will of the ring strengthens.At all costs he seeks the way back into the hands of the people, those people who so easily succumb to his power.The young captain Gondors only needs to stretch out his hand, take the ring and the world will perish.It is close, so close to achieving its goal.For Sauron will command over all life on this earth. Even about the end of the world.The time of the Elves is over.Do we leave Middle Earth to ourselves?Do we abandon them all?What's new?Our scouts report that Saruman attacked Rohan.Théoden's people have fled to Helms Klamm.But our own limits should worry us.Faramir, Orcs are on the move.Sauron sets up an army.Eastlings and Southerners pass the Black Gate.- How many?- Several thousand.Every day more come.- Who's monitoring the river in the north?- 500 men from Osgiliath.If the city is attacked, we will not be able to hold it.Saruman attacks from Isengart.Sauron von Mordor.People will have to fight on both fronts.Gondor is weak.Sauron will attack us soon.And it will be a hard blow.He now knows that we do not have the strength to defend him.My men claim you're Ork-tips.Snipers?You're kidding me!Well, if you're not a snitch, then who are you?Speak!We are Hobbits from the Auenland.Frodo Beutlin is my name. And this is Samweis Gamjie.Your bodyguard?His gardener.And where is your creeping friend?This neglected creature?Quite ugly, one might say.We're on our own.With 7 companions we set out from Bruchtal.One we lost in Moria. 4 hobbits we were. A dwarf was also present.And one Elb and two people:Aragorn, Arathorn's son and Boromir from Gondor.Are you a friend of Boromir's?Yes.I for my part already.Then it grieves you to know that he is dead.Dead?Why?When?As one of his companions I hoped you would tell me.If something happened to Boromir, you have to tell us.His horn was flushed to the riverbank. About 6 days ago.It was split into two parts.But more than this my heart tells me.He was my brother.Boromir!Boromir!This city was once the jewel of our kingdom!A hoard of light, of beauty and music.And this is to become it now!Let Mordor's forces be told:Never again falls the land of my people in the hands of the enemy!The city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed! For Gondor!- For Gondor!- For Gondor!Well spoken.Nice and short.So you have more time to drink.Stitched the barrels!The men here are thirsty!Remember today, little brother.Today life is beautiful.What?He's here.He can't give us a moment of peace.Where is he? Where is he? Where is Gondor's Best?Where's my firstborn?Father!They say, almost alone you had defeated the enemy.You're exaggerating.Faramir has also made himself worthy of victory.If Faramir had done his part, the city would still be.Didn't you have the mission to defend her?I would have defended them, but we were too few.Too few?You have formally invited the enemy to take over the city.As so often you don't let me appear in a good light.That's not my intention.He tries to be your will and you never have any praise for him.- He loves you, Father!- Don't bother me with Faramir. I know about his strengths and there aren't many.We have more urgent things to discuss.Elrond von Bruchtal has convened a council.He doesn't want to tell why, but I can think of the occasion.There's a rumor that you've found the enemy's weapon.The One Ring.Isildur's curse.He got into the hands of the Elves.Everyone wants to seize his.Humans, Dwarves, Wizards.We must not let that happen.This thing has to get to Gondor!- After Gondor...- It's dangerous, I know.Always the ring will try to corrupt the hearts of weak people.But you, you are strong.And our need is great.It is our blood that has been shed; our people who suffer death.Sauron will first wait.He makes masses of troops raise.He will return.And when this happens, we are much too powerless to then stop him.You have to go!Bring me this powerful gift.No. No.My place is here, with my people.Not in Bruchtal!- You refuse your own father?- Is it necessary to ride to Bruchtal,- send me to his place.- You?Ah, I get it.Now Faramir, the captain of Gondor, can show what he is worth.I'd rather not.I only entrust this assignment to your brother.The one who will not disappoint me.Remember today, little brother.Sir Faramir!We found the third one.You have to come with me.Now.Down there.Just coming here and looking at the Forbidden Consecration includes the death penalty.They're waiting for my order.Should I have a shot?In cool ponds wool's we're going to stealSo juicy-sweetAnd on the table comes a fish todaySo juicy-sweetWait!I am bound to this creature.And it's me.It's leading us.Please, let me down to him.Sméagol.The Lord is here.Come on, Sméagol!Trust the Lord, yes?Come on!We have to get out of here now.Sméagol, you must trust the Lord.Follow me.Come on!Come on.Come on, Sméagol!Nice Sméagol.That's it.Come on!Don't hurt him!Sméagol, don't fight!Trust me!My lord!That's enough.Tell me where you're taking her.Answer me!Sméagol.Why is Sméagol crying?Cruel people hurt us.Lord has set us up.Of course he did.I told you he's treacherous.I told you he was wrong.Lord is our friend.Our friend!Lord has betrayed us.No! No!It's none of your business!Leave us alone!Dirty little hobbits!They stole it from us!No. No.No! No!What did they steal?My darling!We have to get out of here.You go.Go on, go!You can do this.Use the ring, Mr. Frodo.Just this time!Put it on.Become invisible.I can't.You were right, Sam.You wanted to warn me, but...I'm sorry.The ring takes possession of me, Sam.If I put him on, he'll find me.He sees it.But, Mr. Frodo...So, this is the solution of all the puzzles.Here in the wilderness I have you, 2 halflings, and a crowd of people under my command.And the ring of power is now very close to me.Now Faramir, the captain of Gondor, can show what he is worth.No! No!Stop it!Leave him alone!Don't you understand?He must destroy him!We're going to Mordor.To the Fiery Mountain!Osgiliath is under fire.They're calling for backup.Please!He's carrying such a load!You have to help him, please!Master of the army?We're leaving.The ring will go to Gondor.He's alive!Where is he?Get out of the way!I'll kill him!You're the smartest, the most cunning, the truly wildest lucky guy I've ever met!Be blessed!Gimli, where is the king?You're late.You look awful.Hosts, do you say?All Isengart is cleared.How many?10,000 head strong, at least.10,000?It is an army, bred for a single purpose:To destroy the world of men.At nightfall, they're here.Let them come.It is every man and every strong boy who is capable of weapons, until nightfall ready to fight.We can secure the dam path and the gate from above.No army has ever broken through the gorge wall or set foot in the Hornburg.This is not a gang of brainless orcs.That's Uruk-hai.Their armors are thick and their shields wide.I fought many wars, Mr. Dwarf.I know to defend my own fortress quite.They will burn against this fortress like water on rock.Saruman's hordes will loot and burn treasure, but we've experienced that before.Crops can be re-seeded, houses re-built.Within these walls we will survive them.You don't want to destroy Rohan's fields or villages.They want to destroy Rohan's people, except for the last child.Tell me what to do.You see my men!Her fighting spirit is almost extinguished.If this is our end, then I want to make it an end that everyone will remember!Send riders out, Lord!You must ask for assistance.And who will come?Elves?Dwarves?We're less fortunate with our friends than you are.Our old alliances are history.- Gondor will help.- Gondor?Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?Where was Gondor when our enemies closed the circle around us?Where was Gon...?No, my Lord Aragorn, we are alone.Take the women and children to the caves.We need more time to withstand a siege.THÉODEN: We don't have time.We're at war!Secure the gate!We Ents have not taken care of the wars of men and sorcerers here for a long time.But now something will happen that has not happened since an age.Entthing.What's that supposed to be?A gathering.A gathering of what?Birch.Oaks.Chestnuts.Ash.Good.Good.Good.Many have come.Now we have to decide whether the Ents will go to war.Hurry up!Go on, guys!Hurry up!We post the second row along the wall.So the archers above the gate are supported.Aragorn, you have to rest.You're not of any use to us.My lord, Aragorn!I am divided to accompany the women into the caves.An honorable task.To look after the children, provide food and beds for the men?This is anything but glorious!My mistress, it will soon be necessary heroism without glory.Then to whom will your people look, in the last defense?Let me stand by your side.It's not in my power to command that.You don't order the others!Nevertheless they fight beside you because they do not want to be separated from you.Just because they love you.I'm sorry.Farmers, hoofsmiths, stable boys.They're not soldiers.Most have experienced too many winters.Or too few.Look at her!They're afraid.I see it in her eyes.And they are about 300...About 10,000!There is more hope for them if they defend themselves here, instead of in Edoras.Aragorn.You can't win this fight.They're all gonna die!Then I will die as one of them!Let him go, boy.Let him grant.Every villager who is able to lead a sword, was sent to the armory.My master?Who am I, Gamling?You are our King, Lord.And do you trust your king?Your men, Lord, follow you to any end.To any end.Where are Horsemen and Ross?And the horn, the widely resounding?Long past, like rain in the forestAnd wind in the branches.In the shadow behind the mountains, the days in the west are sinking.How could it come to this?Hmm?This has been going on for hours now.They must have decided something by now!Decided?No. No.We're just finished with the morning greeting.But now it's in the middle of the night.You can't take your time forever.Just not so hasty.We don't have time now!Come on, hurry up.Give me your sword.What's your name?Haleth, Háma's son, my lord.The men say that we will not survive the night.They say it's hopeless.This is a good sword,Haleth, Háma's son. Hope always exists.We always trusted you.You've never misled us.Forgive me.I shouldn't have doubted.There's nothing to forgive, Legolas.If we had time, I'd have this thing changed.It's a little tight around the chest.It's not an ork horn.Send for the king.- Open the gate!Open the gate!How is that possible?I bring customer of Elrond von Bruchtal.Once there was an alliance between Elben and humans.Long ago we fought and died side by side.This alliance is now being renewed.You are truly welcome.Back with the people to go to battle, fills us with pride.You could really have picked a better place.Well, boy, which may bring you luck, it may last the night.Your friends are with you, Aragorn.They too may survive the night.Show no mercy, for you will not know either.- What's happening out there?- Well, I could describe it to you.Or should I get you a box?Hold on!So then it starts.Get ready!Their armor is weak on the neck and under the arm.Arrows off!Did they hit anything?Send an arrow hail.- Arrows off!- Arrows off!Send them to me!Come on!Ladders!Good!Swords!Swords!Legolas!I've already got two!- I'm at 17!I'm not going to be surpassed by a pointed ear! Hua!19!Merry!We have just agreed.Yes?I told the Entthing your names and we agree: You are not Orcs.That's good news.But what about Saruman?Have you made a decision about him?Don't be too hasty, Mr. Meriadoc.Hastily?Our friends are out there!You need our help!Alone they will not be able to win this war.War?Yes.It affects us all.Tree, root and branch.But you need to know, young Hobbit, that it takes a lot of time to say something in the old Entish. And we only say something when it's worth spending so much time.17!18!19!20!21!The dam path!Is that all?These are your magic tricks, Saruman?Take him down, Legolas!Kill him!Protect the gate!Repel them!Stand firm!Aragorn!Gimli!Attack!The Ents can never ward off this storm.We smell things like that, as we've always done.This can never be your decision!This is not our war.But you are part of this world!Or isn't it?You have to help!Please!You have to do something.You are young and brave, Mr. Merry.But your role in this story is over.Go back home.Maybe Treebeard is right.We don't belong here, Merry.This is too big for us.What can we do?We have the Auenland.We should go home.The fires of Isengart will spread and the forests of Buckelstadt and Bockland will burn.And...Everything that was once green and good in this world will pass away.There will soon be no more Auenland.Aragorn!Pull back into the fortress!Get your men out of there!Into the castle!Back to the castle!Haldir!Into the castle!What are you doing?What are you doing?Haldir!Protect the gate!Stop them!To the gate!Draw your swords!Make way!We can't stand any longer!Stop them!- How much time do you need?As much as you can give me.Gimli!Wooden beams!Hold the gate!Come on.We'll make it.That's pretty far.Throw me.- What?- I can't jump that far.You have to throw me.But don't tell the Elb!Not a word.Barricade the gate!Make way!Makes for more attachment!Watch out!Another one up here!- Up here!Lock the gate!Gimli!Aragorn!Get out of there!Aragorn!Pull everyone back!Tell them to withdraw.Fall back!They broke through!The fortress is occupied!Fall back!Pull back!Fall back!Hurry!In!Everybody in!Into the castle!At the western edge of the forest I will leave you.From there you can head north to your home.Wait!Stop!Stop!Turn around!- Turn around!Take us south!- To the south?But then you pass Isengart.Yes.Exactly.In the south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.The closer we are to the danger, the less can happen to us.This is the last thing he expects.That doesn't sound very obvious to me.On the other hand... you are very small.Maybe you're right.Yeah, so south.Hold on, small foreigners.I always like going south.Somehow you have the feeling, you go downhill.Are you crazy?They'll catch us!They won't.Not this time.Look!Osgiliath burns.Mordor has come.The ring won't be able to save Gondor.He only has the power to destroy.Please let me go!Quick!Faramir!You have to let me go!Mmh, a few field mice that sometimes climb up on me and tickle me terribly.The most comfortable they feel when they...Many of these trees were my friends.Creatures I knew from nut and acorn on.I'm sorry, treebeard.They had their own voice.Saruman!A sorcerer should have more sense!There is no curse in Elbish, Entish, or in the languages of men for such a betrayal.Look!The trees!They're moving!Where are they going?You have something to do with the orcs.My job tonight is Isengart, with rock and stone!Yes.Hrumm, hrumm, coming, my friends.The Ents are going to war.It's probably the way of our demise.The last march of the Ents.Faramir, the orcs have taken over the eastern shore.They are far too numerous.Until night we are overwhelmed.Mr Frodo?He's calling for him, Sam!His eye soon caught me.Hang in there, Mr. Frodo.You can do it!Take her to my father.Tell him Faramir sends a powerful gift.A weapon that will turn our skill in this war.Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?Why did your brother die?He had sworn an oath to protect Frodo. And then he tried to take his ring off.He tried to kill him!Because of the ring, your brother went mad!Watch out!Mr Frodo?They're here!You've come.Nazgûl!Stay here.Don't move.Take cover!The fortress is occupied.It's over.You told me the fortress would never fall as long as your people defended it.They're still defending her.They left their lives for it!You're breaking through!They're in front of the gate!Is there no other way for women and children out of the caves?Is there no other way?There is a path.It leads to the mountains.But they don't get far.The Uruk shark are too numerous.All women and children should go to the mountain path.- and barricade the entrance!- So much death.What can man do against such derisive hatred?Ride out with me.Ride out and fight!For death and glory!For Rohan!For your people!The sun is rising.Expect my coming at the first light of the fifth day.At sunrise looks east.Yes.Yes.The horn helmet Hammerhands is supposed to sound in the gorge. One last time.Yes!This may be the hour, as we draw swords together.Awful deeds awoke!Let's go to anger! Let's go to destruction and bloody tomorrow!To, Eorlingas!Gandalf.King Théoden stands alone.Not quite.Rohirrim!Éomer!For the king!Yes!Hit!Good hit!Break the dam!Free the river!Pippin!Hold on!Hold on, little Hobbits!What are you going to do?Where are you going?I'm's.I, your Sam.Don't you recognize your Sam anymore?I can't do this, Sam.I know.This is all wrong.Actually, we shouldn't be here at all, in this place.But we're here.It's like in the big stories, Mr. Frodo.In those who were really important.They were full of darkness and dangers.Sometimes you didn't want to know the end, because, how could such a story go well?How could the world be like before, when so much bad has happened?Victory!We won!Even the darkness must soften.A new day will come.And when the sun shines, it will shine all the brighter.These were the stories that remain in your memory that were significant.Even if you were still too small to understand them.But I believe, Mr Frodo, I understand now.I know now.The people in these stories always had the opportunity to turn around, just they didn't.They went on because they believed in something.What are we supposed to believe in, Sam?There is something good in this world, Mr. Frodo.And it's worth fighting for.I think, now we understand each other, Frodo Beutlin.You know the laws of your country, the laws of your father.If you let them go, your life is forfeited.Then it's forfeited.Release her!Not in the woods!Stay away from the trees!I count exactly- 42. - 42?Oh, not so bad for a pointed-eared elf prince.On my part, I'm sitting right on number 43 right now.- 43.- He was already dead.- He was still shrugging.- He was still shrugging because I pushed my ax between his nerve strands!He doesn't look very happy, does he?Not at all satisfied, Merry.Nevertheless, you certainly have a magnificent view from up there.Oh, yes.A first-class run house.Even the servants should be excellent.- What are you doing?- Nothing.Everything is as it should be. That's all.Not quite.I'm starving to death.We would have to be lucky if we wanted to find something edible here.There's probably only dead rats and moldy bread here.Saruman's pantry!- I don't trust my eyes!- That's not true!- Yes, it is!- Longsheet!The finest pipe herb in the South Quarter.That fits exactly.A barrel for each of us!Wait!- Shall we give some of that to treebeard?No. No.No. No.Dead plants and all that.I don't think he'd understand.He could be a distant relative.Oh, now I understand.Just not so hasty.Exactly.Barrumm!This is the old channel.It runs below the river to the outskirts of the city.The forest behind it will provide you protection.Sir Faramir, you have shown what you are worth, Lord.The Most High.The Auenland must be truly magnificent, Mr. Gamdschie, where gardeners are highly honored.What way do you take when you reach the forest?Gollum says there is a path near Minas Morgul that leads up to the mountains.Cirith Ungol?Isn't that his name?No, no.- Yes!- Frodo... it's called, a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.- You can't go this way!There is no other way.The Lord has told us he must go to Mordor. So we have to try.I have to.Go, Frodo.Go with the good wishes of all people.Thank you.May cruel death come upon you if you harm them.Come on, don't be so comforting.Mr. Frodo didn't want the forest runners to hurt you.You know that, don't you?He wanted to save you, you know?Save me?So don't be gratifying.- Forgive and forget?- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.Gollum. Gollum.Nice gentleman.- Nice hobbits.Very decent of you.Really decent, Gollum.Sauron's anger will be terrible, his retribution will follow quickly.The battle for Helm's gorge is over.The battle for Middle Earth has only begun.Our hope now rests with 2 little hobbits, somewhere in the wilderness.I'd like to know if we've ever appeared in songs or stories.What?I wonder if people ever say: Let's hear from Frodo and the ring.I'll say yes!This is one of my favorite stories.Frodo was very brave, am I right, Papa?Yes, my boy.Of all Hobbits the most famous.And that says a lot.But you missed one of the main characters:Samweis, the brave.Tell us more about Sam.Frodo wouldn't have gotten far without Sam.Oh, Mr. Frodo, you're making fun of me.I meant it.I mean's also serious.Samweis, the hearted one.Sméagol?We're not waiting for you!Come on!Sir.Lord takes care of us.Lord will not hurt us.Lord has broken his promise.Don't ask Sméagol.Poor, poor, Sméagol.Lord has betrayed us!Ugly!Tricky!Wrong!We're gonna turn his dirty little neck around!Kill him!Kill him!Kill them both!And then we take the treasure and we will be the Lord!But the fat Hobbit, he knows it.Eyes are always vigilant.Then we'll get it out of him!Get his eyes out and he'll have to crawl!Yes, yes, yes!Kill them both.Yes!No, no!It's too dangerous, it's too dangerous.Where is he?Where did he go?- Hey, Gollum!Where are you?Sméagol?We could let them do it.Yes, she could do it.Yes, my darling, she could.And we'll take him as soon as they're dead!As soon as they're dead.Come on, Hobbits!Long way to go.Sméagol shows you the way.Follow me.The Lord of the RingsSméagol!I got one!I have a fish, Sméagol!Come on, pull him up!Déagol!Déagol?Déagol...Give us that, Déagol, my dear.Why?Because today is my birthday and I want's.My darling.We've been cursed.Murderers have been called us.We've been cursed and chased away!Gollum, Gollum, Gollum!And we cried, honey.Weeped because we were so alone.... let's lie down, it's nice and cool for the feetAnd on the table comes today a fish, so juicy sweet.And we forgot the taste of bread, the roar of trees, the caressing of wind.We even forgot our name.My... darling!Wake up!Wake up, you sleeping hats!We have to go!We have to leave right now.Didn't you sleep, Mr. Frodo?I, on the other hand, far too much.- I'm sure it's late.- No, I'm not.It's not even noon.The days are getting darker.Come on!Must go!No time!Not until Mr. Frodo has eaten something.No time to lose, fool!Here.And what about you?No, I'm not hungry.At least not on Lembas bread.Sam!All right.We don't have that much anymore.We have to make sure that we don't run out.But you just eat, Mr. Frodo.I've split it up.That's enough.For what?For the way home.Come on, Hobbitse!Very close now.Close to Mordor.Nowhere safe here.Hurry up!I feel like I'm sitting at home in the Green Dragon after a hard day's work.With the difference that you've never had a hard day's work.Welcome, gentlemen, to Isengart!Because of you they hunt you through the area and now they find you mossing and smoking! You young no-goods!We sit in the field of victory and enjoy some well-deserved amenities.The pickle meat is exceptionally good!Poultrymeat?Hobbits! We are under the command Baumbarts! He is the new administrator of Isengart.Young Master Gandalf!I'm glad you're coming.Wood and water, stick and stone I can master.But here it is necessary to deal with a magician, locked in his tower.And there must remain Saruman, guarded by you, tree beard.Let's cut his head off so that he'll finally be quiet!No! No!His power is dried up.The dirt of Saruman is washed away.Trees will return to live here.Young trees.- Wild trees.With my bark!Peregrin Tuk!I'll take that, my boy.Come on!Tonight we commemorate those who have given their blood to defend this country.- Hail the victorious dead!- Heal!I'm happy for you.He's a glorious man.You are both glorious men.Not Théodes of Rohan has led our people to victory.Don't listen to me.You're young.And tonight is for you.You can look all year and yet find nothing better,Because nowhere does the beer taste as good as's at home.Keep bock and ale, close the noble drops!Because, the real ornament, that's what I'm saying here,Is the Green Dragon Hops!- Thank you!No message from Frodo?Not a word.Nothing.We have time.Every day Frodo gets closer to Mordor.Do we know that?What does your heart tell you?That Frodo is alive.Yes.Yes, he's alive.Too dangerous.Too dangerous.Thieves!They stole it from us.Kill her.Kill them. Kill them both!Quiet!Can't wake her up.Can't spoil it now.But they know!They suspect us!What does that mean, my dear, my dear?Is Sméagol losing his nerves?No. No.Don't.Never!Sméagol hates nasty hobbits.Sméagol sees her most dearly... dead.And we will.Sméagol has done it before.He can do it again.He's ours!Ours!We have to get the treasure back!Patience!Patience, my dear.First we have to take her to her.We'll take them to the winding stairs.Yes, to the stairs.And then?Up, up, up the stairs until we get to the tunnel!And when they go in there, they don't come out again.She's always hungry.She always needs food.She's got to eat.She'll only get dirty orcs.And they don't taste delicious, what, honey?No. No.Not at all delicious, my dear.She wants sweeter meat.Hobbit meat.And if she throws away the bones and the remaining clothes, then we find him.And then it's mine!Us.Yes, we meant each other.Gollum...Gollum!The treasure will be ours once the Hobbitse are dead!You sneaky little...No! No!No! No!Sir!No, Sam, leave him alone!I heard it from his own mouth.He wants to kill us!Sméagol wouldn't do anything to a fly.The disgusting, fat Hobbit does not like Sméagol. That's why he invents mean lies.You wretched little Made!I'll hit your head!Sam!You're the liar!If you chase him away, we're lost!I don't care!I can't wait for him to kill us, Mr. Frodo!- I can't send him away!- You don't understand, do you?He's a villain!We can't do this alone, Sam.Not without a guide.I need you by my side.I am by your side, Mr. Frodo.I know, Sam.I know.Trust me.Come on, Sméagol.The stars are veiled.Something's moving in the east.A sleepless malice.The enemy's eye is approaching.What are you doing?Pippin!Pippin!Pippin!- Are you crazy?- I just want to take a look at it.One last time.Put it back!Pippin!No! No!Pippin!He's here.I see you!Pippin!Help!Gandalf!Help him!Pippin!Naughty Tuk!Look at me!Gandalf. Forgive me.Look at me!What did you see?A tree...A white tree in a stone yard.He was dead.The city was burning.Minas Tirith.Did you see that?I've...I've seen him.I could hear his voice in my head.What did you tell him?Speak!He asked for my name.I haven't answered.He hurt me.What did you tell him about Frodo and the ring?There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.A fool, but an honest fool he remains.He didn't tell Sauron about Frodo and the ring.We have had strange luck.Pippin was able to gain an insight into our enemy's plans in the Palantír.Sauron is planning an attack on the city of Minas Tirith.His defeat at Helms Klamm showed our enemy one thing:That Elendil's legacy has emerged and that people are not so weak.They still have the courage and possibly the strength to challenge him.Sauron fears this.That the peoples of Middle-earth unite will not risk it.Rather he razed Minas Tirith to the ground as the return of a king to the throne of men.When the beacons of Gondors are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.Tell me, why should we hurry to help those who have failed us their help?What do we owe Gondor?- I'm going.- You must be warned!- They will.You have to take another way to Minas Tirith.Follow the river and look for the black ships.You must be aware of one thing:Something is now going on that cannot be undone.I ride to Minas Tirith, but not alone.Of all the nasal hobbits, Peregrin Tuk, you are the worst!Faster!Where are we going?Why did you look?Why do you always have to look at everything?- I don't know.I couldn't help it.- You can never do that.I'm sorry, all right?I'm not doing it again.Haven't you figured it out yet?The enemy believes you have the ring.He'll come looking for you, Pip.They have to get you out of here.But you're coming with me, aren't you?Merry?Come on!How far is Minas Tirith?A three-day ride as the Nazgûl flies.Let's hope we don't have any of those on our heels.Here.A little something for on the go.The rest of the long-leaf!I know you don't have one anymore.You smoke too much, Pip.But I'll see you soon, won't I?Or?I don't know.I don't know what's going to happen.Merry!Run, Shadow Fur. Show us what rush means!Merry!Merry!Guided them in the safest way.A ship is anchored in the grey waters.It is waiting to carry them across the sea, the last journey Arwen Undómiels.There is nothing here for you. Only death.Mrs. Arwen, we can't stay.Mistress!- Tell me what you saw.- Arwen. You have the gift of foresight.What did you see?I've looked into your future and seen death.There is also life there.You saw a child there.You saw my son!This future is already dwindling.But she's not lost.Nothing is certain.Some things are certain.If I leave him now, I will regret it forever.It's time.From ashes fire is struck, from shadows light emerges.Salvation becomes bristled swordand king who lost the crown.Forge the sword anew...Your hands are cool.The lifeblood of the Eldar leaves you.This was my decision.Ada, whether you want it or not, there will be no ship that can take me away.We have just entered the kingdom of Gondor.Minas Tirith.City of Kings.Get out of the way!That's the tree!Gandalf!Gandalf! Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.The King's Tree.But Lord Denethor is not the king.He's just Truchsess, guardian of the throne.Now listen to me:Mr. Denethor is Boromir's father.To convey to him the news of his son's death would be most unwise.And don't mention Frodo or the ring.And you don't say anything about Aragorn either.It's best not to open your mouth, Peregrin Tuk.Salvation, Denethor, Ecthelion's son, Lord and Truchsess of Gondor.I come with a message in this dark hour and with advice.Maybe yours is coming to explain.Maybe your come to explain why my son is dead.Boromir fell to save us, my cousin and me.- When he defended us against enemies.- Pippin!What I can do in services, I offer you to bear this debt.Get up!My Lord, the time to mourn Boromir, there will be, but she is not now.War draws up.The enemy is standing at your doorstep.As a Truchsess, you are entrusted with the defense of this city.Where are Gondor's forces?You still have friends.You're not alone in this fight.Notify Théoden von Rohan.Ignite the beacon!You think you're wise, Mithrandir.Nevertheless, you have no wisdom with all your acumen.Did you think that the eyes of the White Tower were blind?I've seen more than you know.With your left hand you want to use me as a shield against Mordor.And with the right you seek to displace me.I know who rides with Théodes von Rohan.Oh, yes.I've heard of that Aragorn, Arathorn's son.I tell you: To such a forest runner from the north I do not bow, the last from a ragged house, for a long time deprived of the rule!You are not authorized to refuse the king's return, Truchsess!The rule of Gondor is mine!Come on!This is probably just a ceremonial position.They hardly expect me to fight.Or is it?You are now in the service of deception.You will do what you are told to do,Peregrin Tuk, Guardian of the Veste.It's so quiet.That's the deep breath before the jump.I don't want to stand in any battle. But waiting for a who can't escape is even worse.Is there any hope at all, Gandalf? For Frodo and Sam?There was never much hope.Only a fool could hope.Our enemy is ready.All his powers are gathered.Not only orcs, but also people,Armies of Haradrim from the south,Mercenaries from the coast, they will all follow Mordor's call.This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.Here the hammer blow will fall down the most violently.If the river is taken, if the occupation falls in Osgiliath, then this city is no longer to be defended.But we have the White Wizard.This must be good for something.Gandalf?Still Sauron has not revealed his most deadly servant, to those who will lead Mordor's forces in war.Those who say no living man can kill him.The Witch King of Angmar.You've met him before.He wounded Frodo at the top of the weather.He is the prince of the Nazgûl.
